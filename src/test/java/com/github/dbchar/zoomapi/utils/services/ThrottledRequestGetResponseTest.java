Scenario 1: Validate successful retrieval of HttpResponse

Details:
  TestName: getResponseShouldReturnHttpResponseSuccessfully
  Description: This test ensures that the getResponse method returns a valid HttpResponse object when the method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the HttpResponse<String> object to be returned when getResponse is called.
  Act: Call the getResponse method to retrieve the mocked HttpResponse object.
  Assert: Verify that the HttpResponse object returned by the getResponse method is the same as the mocked object.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method returns the expected HttpResponse object. The significance of this test is to confirm that the getResponse method is functioning correctly and returning the pre-set response object.

Scenario 2: Validate the response content type

Details:
  TestName: getResponseShouldHaveCorrectContentType
  Description: This test verifies that the content type of the response returned by getResponse is 'text/plain' or another expected type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mocked HttpResponse<String> object with a specific content type set in the headers.
  Act: Retrieve the response using the getResponse method.
  Assert: Check that the 'Content-Type' header of the response matches the expected content type.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the HttpResponse object has the expected 'Content-Type' header. It's important to ensure that the response is of the correct type, as clients may rely on this information to properly handle the response data.

Scenario 3: Validate response status code for a successful request

Details:
  TestName: getResponseShouldHaveSuccessStatusCode
  Description: This test checks that the getResponse method returns an HttpResponse object with a status code indicating success (e.g., 200 OK).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an HttpResponse<String> object with a status code of 200.
  Act: Retrieve the response using the getResponse method.
  Assert: Verify that the status code of the HttpResponse object is 200.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the response has a successful status code. This test is significant because a successful status code typically indicates that the request was processed correctly, which is a crucial aspect of the method's behavior.

Scenario 4: Validate handling of null response

Details:
  TestName: getResponseShouldHandleNullResponse
  Description: This test ensures that the getResponse method can handle a situation where the response object is null without causing a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the response object to null.
  Act: Call the getResponse method.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns null or handles the null response appropriately.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method does not throw an exception when the response is null. This test is significant for robustness, ensuring that the method behaves predictably even in abnormal conditions.

Scenario 5: Validate immutability of the returned response

Details:
  TestName: getResponseShouldReturnImmutableResponse
  Description: This test checks that the HttpResponse object returned by getResponse is immutable, ensuring that its state cannot be altered after retrieval.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an HttpResponse<String> object and retrieve it using the getResponse method.
  Act: Attempt to modify the state of the retrieved HttpResponse object.
  Assert: Verify that the state of the HttpResponse object has not changed.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the HttpResponse object is immutable. The significance of this test is to ensure that once the response is retrieved, its state remains consistent and is not subject to unexpected changes, which could lead to potential bugs or security issues.

Note: Since the actual implementation details of the `getResponse` method are not provided (such as how the `response` field is populated), some assumptions are made for test scenarios, and some scenarios might not be applicable depending on the actual implementation of the method and the class that contains it.
