================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The method getPublicUrl() may expose sensitive information if the URL contains security-sensitive information or IDs.
Solution: Ensure that any public URL does not contain direct references to protected resources or sensitive information. Implement proper access control checks.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper input validation, the application may be susceptible to injection attacks or may process malicious data.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all inputs to the application, especially those that will be used in network requests or database queries.

Vulnerability: Hardcoded Sensitive Data
Issue: If the variable publicUrl contains or is constructed with sensitive data, it could lead to information disclosure if the codebase is exposed.
Solution: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Use environment variables, configuration files, or secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data, and encrypt them if possible.

Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization
Issue: The usage of Gson for JSON processing without proper validation can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement custom deserializers that validate the integrity and structure of the incoming data before processing it.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
Issue: The code snippet does not include any logging mechanisms which can hinder incident detection and response.
Solution: Integrate a robust logging framework and ensure that all actions, especially exceptions and API requests, are logged adequately.

Vulnerability: Dependence on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: If the application uses inputs from the user or other sources to make security decisions, it could be manipulated by attackers.
Solution: Ensure that security decisions are based on trusted and verified information. Use secure server-side controls for security-sensitive operations.

Vulnerability: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: Exposing a public URL without proper authentication checks can lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Implement strong authentication and authorization checks before allowing access to any sensitive URLs or functions.

Vulnerability: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The code may use functions that can be exploited if not used carefully, such as those that perform network operations or process user input.
Solution: Review and restrict the use of dangerous functions. Apply the principle of least privilege and use safer alternatives where possible.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Issue: If encryption is used in the application, using weak algorithms or keys can lead to data being compromised.
Solution: Use strong, up-to-date encryption algorithms and key management practices. Regularly review cryptographic operations against current standards.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The application might leak information through detailed error messages to the end-user or in logs.
Solution: Implement custom error handling that does not reveal stack traces or sensitive information. Log detailed errors internally and show generic error messages to users.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate getPublicUrl returns correct URL

Details:  
TestName: shouldReturnCorrectPublicUrl
Description: This test ensures that the getPublicUrl method returns the correct public URL that has been previously set or initialized within the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object containing the getPublicUrl method and set the publicUrl to a known value.
  Act: Call the getPublicUrl method to retrieve the URL.
  Assert: Assert that the returned URL matches the known value that was set.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getPublicUrl method correctly retrieves the value of publicUrl. This is significant because it confirms that the object correctly maintains its state and provides access to its public URL as expected.

Scenario 2: Validate getPublicUrl handles null

Details:  
TestName: shouldHandleNullPublicUrl
Description: This test checks that the getPublicUrl method returns null when the publicUrl has not been initialized or explicitly set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object containing the getPublicUrl method without setting the publicUrl, or explicitly set it to null.
  Act: Call the getPublicUrl method to retrieve the URL.
  Assert: Assert that the returned URL is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion ensures that getPublicUrl does not throw an exception or return an incorrect value when the publicUrl is null. This test is important as it verifies the method's robustness and its ability to handle uninitialized or explicitly null states.

Scenario 3: Validate getPublicUrl is consistent across multiple calls

Details:  
TestName: shouldReturnConsistentPublicUrlOnMultipleCalls
Description: This test ensures that multiple invocations of the getPublicUrl method return the same value, provided that the publicUrl has not been changed between the calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object containing the getPublicUrl method and set the publicUrl to a known value.
  Act: Call the getPublicUrl method multiple times to retrieve the URL.
  Assert: Assert that all returned URLs from the multiple calls are the same and match the known value.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks for the consistency of the getPublicUrl method across multiple invocations. It is significant as it verifies that the method is free from side effects and confirms the immutability of the publicUrl within the object's lifecycle, assuming it is not modified externally.

Scenario 4: Validate getPublicUrl after updating publicUrl

Details:  
TestName: shouldReflectUpdatedPublicUrl
Description: This test verifies that after updating the publicUrl field, the getPublicUrl method returns the updated URL.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object containing the getPublicUrl method, set the publicUrl to an initial value, then update it to a new value.
  Act: Call the getPublicUrl method to retrieve the updated URL.
  Assert: Assert that the returned URL matches the new value set.
Validation: 
  This assertion ensures that the getPublicUrl method reflects the latest state of the publicUrl. This test is important to confirm that the object's state can be updated and that the getPublicUrl method provides the most current data.

These scenarios cover the basic functionality and edge cases for the getPublicUrl method, ensuring that it behaves as expected under various conditions.
