================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Import Statements
Issue: The presence of multiple import statements on a single line and the use of wildcard imports can lead to unintentional usage of classes and make it difficult to identify which classes are actually needed, potentially including vulnerable or malicious classes.
Solution: Import only the required classes explicitly and avoid using wildcard imports to minimize the risk of including unnecessary or insecure classes. Review all imports for their necessity and safety.

Vulnerability: Exposure of Sensitive Information
Issue: The method getUri() exposes the internal URI which may contain sensitive information that could be exploited if accessed by an attacker.
Solution: Avoid exposing methods that can provide access to sensitive information. If such access is necessary, ensure it is protected by proper access control mechanisms and is not exposed to untrusted code or users.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: Without proper input validation on data received from external sources or user input, the system is vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection, command injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS).
Solution: Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization to ensure that only valid and expected data is processed. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to mitigate injection vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: Potential Resource Leak
Issue: The code might be using network resources or I/O operations without proper closing or error handling, which could lead to resource leaks and denial of service (DoS) if the resources are exhausted.
Solution: Always close resources in a finally block or use try-with-resources to ensure that resources are closed even in the event of an error.

Vulnerability: Insecure Error Handling
Issue: The lack of proper error handling could lead to the exposure of stack traces or sensitive information, allowing an attacker to gain insights into the system.
Solution: Implement proper error handling that logs errors without revealing sensitive information to the user. Use generic error messages for end-users and detailed logs for administrators with secure access.

Vulnerability: Insecure Usage of Third-party Libraries
Issue: The code includes third-party libraries which may contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not kept up to date.
Solution: Regularly check for updates and patches of the third-party libraries used. Employ tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies and update or replace libraries that are no longer maintained or have known security issues.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate proper URI retrieval

Details:  
  TestName: validateUriRetrieval
  Description: This test ensures that the getUri method returns the correct URI string as set in the instance variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getUri method and set the uri instance variable to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getUri method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the known URI value set in the instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the getUri method correctly retrieves the value of the uri instance variable. This is important to confirm that the method is accessing the correct property and returning the expected data.

Scenario 2: Validate getUri with null URI

Details:  
  TestName: validateUriWithNullValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getUri method returns null when the uri instance variable is not set (i.e., it is null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getUri method without setting the uri instance variable.
  Act: Invoke the getUri method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the getUri method handles the case when the uri instance variable is not initialized and returns a null value. This is significant for validating the method's behavior in scenarios where the URI is not available.

Scenario 3: Validate getUri after setting URI

Details:  
  TestName: validateUriAfterSettingValue
  Description: This test checks that the getUri method returns the updated URI after the uri instance variable has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getUri method, set the uri instance variable to an initial value, then update it to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getUri method after the update.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the new updated URI value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getUri method reflects changes made to the uri instance variable, ensuring that the method returns the current state of the instance variable.

Scenario 4: Validate thread safety of getUri

Details:  
  TestName: validateThreadSafetyOfGetUri
  Description: This test ensures that the getUri method is thread-safe and returns the correct URI value when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getUri method and set the uri instance variable. Create multiple threads that will call the getUri method concurrently.
  Act: Start all threads and then join them to ensure they all complete execution.
  Assert: Assert that all threads received the same URI value.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks for consistency in the returned URI value across all threads. This test is significant for applications where the getUri method may be accessed by multiple threads concurrently, ensuring thread safety.

Scenario 5: Validate getUri with empty URI

Details:  
  TestName: validateUriWithEmptyValue
  Description: This test checks that the getUri method returns an empty string when the uri instance variable is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getUri method and set the uri instance variable to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getUri method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the getUri method correctly handles the case where the uri instance variable is intentionally set to an empty string. This test is important to confirm that the method does not throw an error or return null in such cases.
