================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The public method 'getRequest' exposes the internal HttpRequest object, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive information such as API keys or credentials embedded in the request headers or URL.
Solution: Limit the exposure of sensitive information by not providing direct access to the HttpRequest object. Instead, provide a method that exposes only the necessary details or perform the sensitive operations within the class without exposing the HttpRequest object.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The HttpRequest object 'request' is not encapsulated within the class. If the 'request' field is not declared as private, it could be accessible by other classes in the same package, leading to unauthorized access and modification.
Solution: Declare the HttpRequest object 'request' as private to ensure that it cannot be accessed directly by other classes. Provide controlled access through public getter and/or setter methods with proper validation.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings
Issue: If the HttpRequest object is of type GET and contains sensitive information in the query string, this information could be logged in server logs or be exposed through the browser history or Referer header.
Solution: Avoid sending sensitive information as part of the query string in a GET request. Use POST requests with the sensitive data in the request body, or apply encryption and other security measures to protect such information.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: If the HttpRequest is sent over an insecure channel (HTTP instead of HTTPS), sensitive information contained within could be intercepted by an attacker.
Solution: Always use HTTPS for sending HttpRequest objects that contain sensitive data. Ensure that the server's SSL/TLS configuration is up to date and that it enforces strong encryption protocols and ciphers.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: Similar to CWE-311, if HttpRequest data is transmitted in cleartext, it can be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
Solution: Use HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit. Additionally, consider implementing application-level encryption for particularly sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Active Debug Code
Issue: The presence of debug code or verbose error handling in production systems can leak sensitive information or provide hints to an attacker about the system's internals.
Solution: Ensure that debug code and verbose error messages are removed or properly secured before deploying the application to production. Use logging levels to control the output of potentially sensitive information.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of HttpRequest

Details:  
  TestName: getRequestShouldReturnHttpRequestInstance
  Description: This test ensures that the getRequest method returns a valid instance of HttpRequest when called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an ApiRequest object with a predefined HttpRequest.
  Act: Call the getRequest method on the ApiRequest object.
  Assert: Assert that the result is not null and is an instance of HttpRequest.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getRequest method returns an actual HttpRequest object. The test confirms that the method functions correctly by returning the request it was initialized with. This is significant for the application's ability to perform network operations as expected.

Scenario 2: Consistent Return Value on Multiple Calls

Details:
  TestName: getRequestShouldReturnSameInstanceOnMultipleCalls
  Description: This test checks if multiple calls to getRequest return the same HttpRequest instance, ensuring the method's consistency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an ApiRequest object with a predefined HttpRequest.
  Act: Call the getRequest method on the ApiRequest object multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that the returned HttpRequest instance is the same across all calls.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getRequest method consistently returns the same instance of HttpRequest on multiple invocations. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that the application's state remains stable and predictable across multiple network requests.

Scenario 3: HttpRequest Modification Persistence

Details:
  TestName: modificationsToHttpRequestShouldPersist
  Description: This test ensures that any modifications made to the HttpRequest returned by getRequest persist across subsequent retrievals.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an ApiRequest object with a predefined HttpRequest. Modify the HttpRequest instance obtained from getRequest.
  Act: Retrieve the HttpRequest again using getRequest.
  Assert: Assert that the modifications made to the HttpRequest are present in the newly retrieved instance.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the getRequest method returns a reference to the same HttpRequest object, such that any modifications are persistent. This is important for scenarios where the HttpRequest might be altered between different parts of the code, and those changes need to be maintained.

Scenario 4: Thread Safety of getRequest

Details:
  TestName: getRequestShouldBeThreadSafe
  Description: This test assesses whether the getRequest method is thread-safe and returns consistent results when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an ApiRequest object with a predefined HttpRequest. Create multiple threads to call getRequest on the ApiRequest object.
  Act: Execute all threads and retrieve HttpRequest instances.
  Assert: Assert that all threads receive the same HttpRequest instance and no concurrency issues occur.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that getRequest can be safely called by multiple threads without leading to race conditions or inconsistent results. Thread safety is vital for applications that operate in a multi-threaded environment and rely on the consistent behavior of objects accessed by concurrent threads.
