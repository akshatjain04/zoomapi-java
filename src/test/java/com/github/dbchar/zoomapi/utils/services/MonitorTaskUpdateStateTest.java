================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: If the OAuthZoomClient uses insecure or deprecated cryptographic algorithms, it could lead to vulnerabilities that compromise the security of communications.
Solution: Ensure that OAuthZoomClient employs up-to-date and secure cryptographic algorithms, such as AES with a key size of at least 128 bits for encryption and SHA-256 or greater for hashing.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: Direct usage of SQLiteManager without proper input validation or parameterized queries could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to handle database operations and implement input validation to mitigate SQL injection risks.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: If sensitive data such as messages or user details are stored or transmitted without encryption, they could be exposed to unauthorized parties.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong encryption protocols, and manage encryption keys securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: If the SQLite database file created by SQLiteManager has insecure default permissions, it might be accessible by unauthorized users.
Solution: Set secure file permissions for the SQLite database file to restrict access to authorized users only.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: If Logger or Utils classes log sensitive information without proper safeguards, it could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Implement logging best practices by masking or omitting sensitive information from logs and ensuring log files are stored securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: If the application relies on input from an untrusted source to make security decisions, it could be susceptible to attacks.
Solution: Never trust input from external sources. Validate and sanitize all input, and use trusted data to make security decisions.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: If critical resources such as user data or configuration files are given incorrect permissions, it may lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Regularly audit permissions for critical resources and ensure they are set according to the principle of least privilege.

Vulnerability: CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: If the application allows file uploads without proper validation, it could lead to the upload of malicious files.
Solution: Implement strict validation on file uploads, check file types and contents, and store files in a secure manner.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: If the application downloads code or updates without verifying their integrity, it could be compromised by malicious code.
Solution: Ensure all code downloads or updates are obtained from trusted sources and verify their integrity using cryptographic signatures or checksums.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without validation, it could lead to remote code execution or other attacks.
Solution: Avoid deserializing objects from untrusted sources. If deserialization is necessary, use safe serialization libraries and implement integrity checks and input validation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Initialized State Monitoring

Details:
  TestName: updateStateWithInitializedFlagTrue
  Description: This test ensures that when the `initialized` flag is set to true, the method `updateState` invokes the `monitorMessages` and `monitorMembers` methods.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the necessary classes and set the `initialized` flag to true.
  Act: Call the `updateState` method.
  Assert: Verify that `monitorMessages` and `monitorMembers` methods are called.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the `monitorMessages` and `monitorMembers` methods are invoked when the `initialized` flag is true. This is important to confirm that the state update process is functioning correctly when the system is already initialized.

Scenario 2: Uninitialized State No Monitoring

Details:
  TestName: updateStateWithInitializedFlagFalse
  Description: This test checks that when the `initialized` flag is set to false, the `updateState` method does not call `monitorMessages` or `monitorMembers`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock necessary classes and set the `initialized` flag to false.
  Act: Call the `updateState` method.
  Assert: Verify that neither `monitorMessages` nor `monitorMembers` methods are called.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that no state monitoring methods are called when the system is not initialized. This is crucial to prevent any unintended behavior or errors in an uninitialized state.

Scenario 3: Monitoring Messages Throws Exception

Details:
  TestName: updateStateMonitoringMessagesExceptionHandling
  Description: This test verifies that the `updateState` method handles exceptions thrown by `monitorMessages` without halting the execution of `monitorMembers`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock necessary classes, set the `initialized` flag to true, and simulate an exception when `monitorMessages` is called.
  Act: Call the `updateState` method.
  Assert: Ensure that `monitorMembers` is still called despite the exception in `monitorMessages`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the robustness of the `updateState` method in handling exceptions. This test is significant for maintaining application stability, ensuring that one faulty monitoring component does not affect the execution of others.

Scenario 4: Monitoring Members Throws Exception

Details:
  TestName: updateStateMonitoringMembersExceptionHandling
  Description: This test verifies that the `updateState` method handles exceptions thrown by `monitorMembers` gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock necessary classes, set the `initialized` flag to true, and simulate an exception when `monitorMembers` is called.
  Act: Call the `updateState` method.
  Assert: Verify that the exception is handled without crashing the application.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that `updateState` can handle exceptions from `monitorMembers`. This test is important to prevent the application from crashing due to unhandled exceptions and to ensure that error handling is in place.

Scenario 5: Initialized State with Multiple Invocations

Details:
  TestName: updateStateMultipleInvocations
  Description: This test checks that multiple invocations of `updateState` will consistently call `monitorMessages` and `monitorMembers` when the `initialized` flag remains true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock necessary classes, set the `initialized` flag to true, and track the number of times `monitorMessages` and `monitorMembers` are called.
  Act: Call the `updateState` method multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that each method is called the expected number of times.
Validation:
  The assertion validates the consistent behavior of the `updateState` method across multiple calls. This test ensures that the state update process is reliable and functions as intended over time.
