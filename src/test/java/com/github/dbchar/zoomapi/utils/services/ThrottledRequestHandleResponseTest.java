================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The 'handleResponse' method exposes the HttpResponse object to a Consumer without validating or sanitizing the response content, which could lead to injection attacks if the consumer is not implemented securely.
Solution: Implement validation and sanitization of the response content before passing it to the Consumer. Ensure that all data is treated as untrusted and is checked against a whitelist of allowed content.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: If the HttpRequest object is not configured to use HTTPS, sensitive data transmitted over the network could be intercepted by an attacker.
Solution: Always use HTTPS for transmitting sensitive data and ensure certificates are validated properly.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The code does not demonstrate any form of authentication for the API requests, which could result in unauthorized access if the API endpoints are not properly secured.
Solution: Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or API keys, and ensure that all API endpoints require authentication.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The 'handleResponse' method uses the response from an external source to make security decisions without proper validation, which could be manipulated by an attacker.
Solution: Never trust external inputs for security decisions. Validate and sanitize all inputs rigorously.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Logging or debugging information may inadvertently expose sensitive information from the HttpResponse object if not handled properly.
Solution: Implement proper logging levels and ensure that sensitive information is never logged. Use a logging framework that supports redaction of sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful response handling

Details:  
  TestName: successfulResponseHandling
  Description: This test checks if the method handleResponse correctly passes the HttpResponse object to the responseHandler consumer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpResponse object with a successful status code and a mock Consumer instance, setting expectations for its accept method to be called with the mock HttpResponse.
  Act: Call the handleResponse method with the mocked HttpResponse object.
  Assert: Verify that the mock Consumer's accept method was called with the correct HttpResponse object.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the responseHandler consumer is invoked with the correct HttpResponse object, ensuring that the response is being processed properly. This is significant as it confirms the method's primary functionality of delegating response handling.

Scenario 2: Null response handling

Details:  
  TestName: nullResponseHandling
  Description: This test ensures that the method handleResponse can handle null HttpResponse objects without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a mock Consumer instance that expects no interaction.
  Act: Call the handleResponse method with a null HttpResponse object.
  Assert: Confirm that no interactions have occurred with the mock Consumer instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the responseHandler consumer is not invoked when the HttpResponse object is null, which is important to prevent null pointer exceptions in the application flow.

Scenario 3: Consumer throws exception

Details:  
  TestName: consumerThrowsException
  Description: This test checks the behavior of handleResponse if the responseHandler consumer throws an exception when processing the HttpResponse.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpResponse object and a mock Consumer instance that throws a RuntimeException when its accept method is called.
  Act: Call the handleResponse method with the mocked HttpResponse object and catch any exceptions that are thrown.
  Assert: Verify that the exception is caught and assert its type to ensure proper exception handling.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the method handleResponse is robust and can handle exceptions thrown by the responseHandler consumer. This is critical for maintaining application stability in the face of unexpected runtime issues.

Scenario 4: Response with error status code

Details:  
  TestName: responseWithErrorStatusCode
  Description: This test verifies that the method handleResponse correctly passes HttpResponse objects with error status codes to the responseHandler.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpResponse object with an error status code and a mock Consumer instance, expecting its accept method to be called with the error status code.
  Act: Call the handleResponse method with the mocked error status code HttpResponse object.
  Assert: Verify that the mock Consumer's accept method was called with the HttpResponse object containing the error status code.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that error status codes in HttpResponse objects are processed by the responseHandler consumer. This is important for enabling the application to handle error scenarios gracefully.

Scenario 5: Consumer processes response content

Details:  
  TestName: consumerProcessesResponseContent
  Description: This test checks if the Consumer properly processes the content of the HttpResponse when passed to it by handleResponse.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpResponse object with a specific body content and a mock Consumer instance that processes the content and performs an action or transformation.
  Act: Call the handleResponse method with the mocked HttpResponse object.
  Assert: Verify that the action or transformation on the content was performed as expected.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the responseHandler consumer is capable of processing the content of the HttpResponse. This is essential for ensuring that response data is handled correctly in the application, such as parsing JSON responses or handling XML data.

Remember, these scenarios are hypothetical and assume certain behaviors of the Consumer and HttpResponse. In practice, you would need to conform to the actual implementations and behaviors of these classes.
