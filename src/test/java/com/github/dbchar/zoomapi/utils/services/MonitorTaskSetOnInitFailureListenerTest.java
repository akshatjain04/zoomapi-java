================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Import Statement
Issue: The code imports multiple classes with a single import statement separated by commas, which is a syntax error and could lead to compilation failure, potentially causing runtime issues if not detected.
Solution: Correct the import statements by separating them into individual lines, each starting with 'import' followed by the fully qualified class name.

Vulnerability: Insecure Exception Handling
Issue: The setOnInitFailureListener method does not throw or handle any exceptions that may occur within the listener's execution, potentially leading to uncaught exceptions at runtime.
Solution: Implement proper exception handling within the listener or ensure that the listener's implementation includes exception handling to prevent runtime crashes.

Vulnerability: Exposure of Sensitive Information
Issue: The Logger utility class is imported, which might be used to log sensitive information. If the logger is misconfigured or logs are not properly secured, sensitive data could be exposed.
Solution: Ensure that the Logger class filters out sensitive information from logs and that log files are stored securely with restricted access.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Issue: The SQLiteManager class is imported, which suggests interaction with a database. If SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation with untrusted input, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Solution: Use prepared statements or an ORM that escapes inputs by default to protect against SQL injection attacks. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not provide any input validation on the listener being set in setOnInitFailureListener, which may lead to the setting of an inappropriate or malicious listener.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the listener provided to setOnInitFailureListener adheres to a specific interface or class type expected by the application.

Vulnerability: Use of Potentially Unsafe Third-Party Libraries
Issue: The code imports various third-party libraries (e.g., OAuthZoomClient, Message, User). If these libraries are not kept up-to-date or are used incorrectly, they could introduce vulnerabilities.
Solution: Regularly update third-party libraries to their latest secure versions, review their security advisories, and follow best practices for their usage.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid listener provided

Details:  
  TestName: setOnInitFailureListenerWithValidRunnable
  Description: This test checks that the method correctly stores the provided Runnable object for later use when an initialization failure occurs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Runnable object.
  Act: Call setOnInitFailureListener with the mock Runnable.
  Assert: Verify that the onInitFailureListener field is set to the mock Runnable.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the onInitFailureListener field holds a reference to the passed Runnable object, which is expected to be used when an initialization failure occurs. This is significant for ensuring that the appropriate action is triggered upon failure.

Scenario 2: Null listener provided

Details:  
  TestName: setOnInitFailureListenerWithNull
  Description: This test verifies that the method does nothing when a null listener is passed, leaving the onInitFailureListener unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Store the current state of the onInitFailureListener field. Provide a null as the listener parameter.
  Act: Call setOnInitFailureListener with null.
  Assert: Verify that the onInitFailureListener field remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method preserves the existing onInitFailureListener when provided with a null listener. This is important to prevent nullifying an already set listener, which would disable the intended failure handling.

Scenario 3: Listener replaced with a new valid listener

Details:  
  TestName: setOnInitFailureListenerWithNewValidRunnable
  Description: This test ensures that the method can replace an existing listener with a new one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an initial mock Runnable as the listener, then create a different mock Runnable.
  Act: Call setOnInitFailureListener with the new mock Runnable.
  Assert: Verify that the onInitFailureListener field is updated to the new mock Runnable.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the onInitFailureListener field can be updated with a new listener, allowing for dynamic changes in behavior upon initialization failure. This is essential for scenarios where the failure handling strategy needs to be modified at runtime.

Scenario 4: Listener set when there was no previous listener

Details:  
  TestName: setOnInitFailureListenerWhenNoPreviousListener
  Description: This test checks that the method correctly sets a listener when none was set before.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the onInitFailureListener is null. Create a mock Runnable object.
  Act: Call setOnInitFailureListener with the mock Runnable.
  Assert: Verify that the onInitFailureListener field is set to the mock Runnable.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method is capable of setting an initialization failure listener when it is first provided. This confirms the method's ability to initialize the failure handling mechanism.

Scenario 5: Listener remains unchanged when set to the same listener

Details:  
  TestName: setOnInitFailureListenerWithSameRunnable
  Description: This test verifies that setting the same listener that is already set does not cause any changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a mock Runnable as the listener. Use the same mock Runnable for the test.
  Act: Call setOnInitFailureListener with the same mock Runnable.
  Assert: Verify that the onInitFailureListener field remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method does not unnecessarily update the listener reference if it is set to the same object. This is important for avoiding redundant operations and ensuring the method's idempotency.
