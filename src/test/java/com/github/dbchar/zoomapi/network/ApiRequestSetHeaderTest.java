ROOST_METHOD_HASH=setHeader_9923928b59
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setHeader_c8883d69f5

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The 'setHeader' method allows any Object as a value, which could include untrusted input. If the value is logged without neutralization, it could lead to log injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure all log entries are properly sanitized, and validate or encode data before logging it.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method does not perform input validation on the header key or value, which could lead to security issues if the input is controlled by an attacker.
Solution: Implement strict input validation for header keys and values, allowing only a predefined set of safe inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: If the 'setHeader' method is used to set headers such as 'Authorization', it could potentially expose hard-coded credentials in the code base.
Solution: Avoid hard-coded credentials. Use secure mechanisms like environment variables, configuration files, or secrets management systems to handle sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The 'setHeader' method may inadvertently set insecure headers that could lead to exposing sensitive information or security controls.
Solution: Review the default headers being set and ensure they conform to the principle of least privilege, only exposing what is necessary.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Set a new valid header

Details:  
  TestName: setNewValidHeader
  Description: Validate that a new header can be set successfully with valid key and value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap to mimic the headers collection. Define a key and value pair to be added.
  Act: Call the setHeader method with the key and value.
  Assert: Verify that the headers HashMap contains the new key-value pair.
Validation: 
  Check that the key-value pair exists in the headers HashMap. This validates that the setHeader method correctly adds new headers, which is essential for setting up HTTP requests.

Scenario 2: Update an existing header

Details:  
  TestName: updateExistingHeader
  Description: Verify that if an existing header is set with a new value, the value is updated accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap with an existing header. Define a new value for this header.
  Act: Call the setHeader method with the existing header's key and the new value.
  Assert: Confirm that the header's value is updated to the new value in the headers HashMap.
Validation: 
  Ensure that the existing header's value is updated, proving that setHeader can modify existing headers, which is important for maintaining the flexibility of HTTP requests.

Scenario 3: Set a header with a null key

Details:  
  TestName: setHeaderWithNullKey
  Description: Ensure that attempting to set a header with a null key is handled properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap for headers. Define a null key and a valid value.
  Act: Call the setHeader method with the null key and the value.
  Assert: Expect an exception or verify that the header is not added to the HashMap.
Validation: 
  Confirm that the method does not allow adding a header with a null key, which is important to prevent invalid HTTP requests.

Scenario 4: Set a header with a null value

Details:  
  TestName: setHeaderWithNullValue
  Description: Confirm that a header can be set with a null value if the underlying headers collection supports it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap for headers. Define a valid key and a null value.
  Act: Call the setHeader method with the key and the null value.
  Assert: Verify that the headers HashMap contains the key with a null value.
Validation: 
  Check that the headers HashMap can store a null value, which may be necessary for certain HTTP requests that allow headers with no value.

Scenario 5: Set a header with an empty string key

Details:  
  TestName: setHeaderWithEmptyStringKey
  Description: Verify that setting a header with an empty string key is handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap for headers. Define an empty string key and a valid value.
  Act: Call the setHeader method with the empty string key and the value.
  Assert: Expect an exception or verify that the header is not added to the HashMap.
Validation: 
  Confirm that the method does not allow adding a header with an empty string key, which is important for maintaining the integrity of HTTP request headers.

Scenario 6: Set a header with a very long key

Details:  
  TestName: setHeaderWithVeryLongKey
  Description: Validate that a header with a very long key is handled properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap for headers. Define a very long string key and a valid value.
  Act: Call the setHeader method with the long key and the value.
  Assert: Verify that the headers HashMap contains the new key-value pair.
Validation: 
  Ensure that the method can handle long keys, which might be necessary for certain applications or services that require extensive header names.

Scenario 7: Set a header with a special character key

Details:  
  TestName: setHeaderWithSpecialCharacterKey
  Description: Check that a header with a key containing special characters is added correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap for headers. Define a key with special characters and a valid value.
  Act: Call the setHeader method with the special character key and the value.
  Assert: Verify that the headers HashMap contains the new key-value pair.
Validation: 
  Confirm that keys with special characters are accepted, which is important for applications that might use such keys for their headers.

Scenario 8: Set multiple headers with unique keys

Details:  
  TestName: setMultipleHeadersWithUniqueKeys
  Description: Ensure that setting multiple headers with unique keys works as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap for headers. Define multiple key-value pairs with unique keys.
  Act: Call the setHeader method multiple times with each unique key-value pair.
  Assert: Verify that the headers HashMap contains all the new key-value pairs.
Validation: 
  Confirm that multiple headers can be set without overwriting each other, which is critical for constructing valid HTTP requests with multiple headers.

Scenario 9: Set multiple headers with the same key

Details:  
  TestName: setMultipleHeadersWithSameKey
  Description: Verify that setting multiple headers with the same key overwrites the previous value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap for headers. Define a key and multiple values.
  Act: Call the setHeader method multiple times with the same key but different values.
  Assert: Verify that the headers HashMap contains only the last value associated with the key.
Validation: 
  Confirm that when the same key is used multiple times, only the last value is retained, which is the expected behavior for HTTP headers that do not support multiple values for the same key.
