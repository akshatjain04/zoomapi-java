================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The data returned by getHeaders() could contain control or other non-printable characters that, if logged, could be used to carry out log injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure that all data being logged is sanitized by escaping or removing control characters before logging, or use a logging framework that automatically sanitizes log entries.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure Through Sent Data
Issue: The getHeaders() method exposes a map of headers, which could contain sensitive information such as authentication tokens, cookies, or user data. If this information is intercepted or logged improperly, it could be exploited.
Solution: Minimize exposure of sensitive information by using secure methods of transmission (such as HTTPS), and avoid logging sensitive data. Implement access controls to limit who can retrieve such headers.

Vulnerability: CWE-499: Public Data Assigned to Private Array-Typed Field
Issue: If the headers map contains mutable objects, and it is returned directly to the caller, the caller could modify the contents of the map, potentially affecting the state of the object holding the headers.
Solution: Return a copy of the headers map or an unmodifiable view to prevent the caller from modifying the original map's content.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: RetrieveHeadersWhenNotEmpty

Details:  
  TestName: retrieveHeadersWhenNotEmpty
  Description: This test ensures that the getHeaders method correctly returns a non-empty map when headers are present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a HashMap with some key-value pairs and assign it to the 'headers' field of the containing class.
  Act: Call the getHeaders method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map is equal to the expected map with the headers that were set up in the arrange step.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the map returned by getHeaders contains all the key-value pairs that were added, ensuring that headers are correctly retrieved when they exist.
  This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getHeaders method in a scenario where headers are expected to be present.

Scenario 2: RetrieveHeadersWhenEmpty

Details:  
  TestName: retrieveHeadersWhenEmpty
  Description: This test checks that the getHeaders method returns an empty map when no headers have been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the 'headers' field of the containing class is initialized to an empty HashMap or not set at all.
  Act: Call the getHeaders method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that getHeaders does not fabricate headers and returns an empty map when no headers are present.
  This test is crucial for verifying the method's behavior in a situation where no headers have been added, which is a common edge case.

Scenario 3: RetrieveHeadersImmutabilityCheck

Details:  
  TestName: retrieveHeadersImmutabilityCheck
  Description: This test verifies that the map returned by the getHeaders method is not modifiable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the 'headers' field of the containing class with a non-empty HashMap.
  Act: Call the getHeaders method and attempt to modify the returned map.
  Assert: Catch any UnsupportedOperationException that may be thrown and assert that it is indeed thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the map is immutable, which is important for preventing accidental modifications to the class's internal state.
  The significance of this test is to ensure the integrity of the headers, as they should not be changed outside of designated methods.

Scenario 4: RetrieveHeadersNullCheck

Details:  
  TestName: retrieveHeadersNullCheck
  Description: This test ensures that the getHeaders method does not return null even if the headers field is not initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not initialize the 'headers' field of the containing class, leaving it as null.
  Act: Call the getHeaders method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method handles null fields gracefully and always returns a valid map object, preventing null pointer exceptions.
  This test is important because it checks the robustness of the method in dealing with uninitialized fields, which is a potential edge case.

Scenario 5: RetrieveHeadersThreadSafetyCheck

Details:  
  TestName: retrieveHeadersThreadSafetyCheck
  Description: This test checks whether the getHeaders method is thread-safe and can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously without data corruption.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the 'headers' field with a HashMap and start multiple threads that access the getHeaders method.
  Act: Each thread calls the getHeaders method and performs read operations on the returned map.
  Assert: After all threads have completed, assert that the headers have not been modified and are consistent across all threads.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks for thread safety by ensuring that concurrent access does not lead to inconsistent or corrupted state.
  This test is significant because it assesses the method's ability to handle concurrent access, which is crucial for multi-threaded applications.
