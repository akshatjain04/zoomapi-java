================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The getQueries method returns a Map that could contain user-controlled data. If this data is not properly sanitized before being displayed in a web page, it could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Ensure all user-controlled data is properly escaped or sanitized when rendered in a web page. Use context-specific escaping libraries or functions to prevent XSS.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not show any validation on the input that is being processed by the getQueries method. Without proper validation, the application might be susceptible to various forms of input-based attacks.
Solution: Implement rigorous input validation using a allowlist approach. Ensure that all inputs are validated against strict criteria before use.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code provided includes import statements that may throw UnsupportedEncodingException. If this exception is not properly handled, it could expose sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Catch potential exceptions and handle them gracefully without revealing sensitive information. Use custom error messages that do not expose system details.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: Although not directly shown in the code snippet, if the application parses XML input, it could be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks without proper safeguards.
Solution: If XML processing is used, configure the XML parser to disallow external entities and DOCTYPE declarations. Use secure coding practices to prevent XXE.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: If any sensitive information is transmitted as part of the queries or in headers, using an unencrypted connection could expose it to interception.
Solution: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and ensure that sensitive information is never transmitted in cleartext.

Vulnerability: CWE-862: Missing Authorization
Issue: The code does not explicitly demonstrate any authorization checks, which might lead to unauthorized access if the method is exposed to users without proper access control.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive methods or data.

Vulnerability: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Issue: If user input is used to construct URLs for server-side requests, it could be manipulated to access internal resources.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all user input used to construct URLs. Implement strict allowlists for URLs and schemes that the application can request.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify that getQueries returns an empty map when no queries are set

Details:  
  TestName: getQueriesShouldReturnEmptyMapWhenNoQueriesSet
  Description: This test checks whether the getQueries method returns an empty map when no query parameters have been added to the queries map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the getQueries method, ensuring that the queries map is empty.
  Act: Call the getQueries method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned map is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where no queries have been set. An empty map is the expected result if there have been no additions to the queries map. This test is significant as it validates the method's ability to handle the default case correctly.

Scenario 2: Verify that getQueries returns the correct map with single query parameter set

Details:  
  TestName: getQueriesShouldReturnMapWithSingleQuery
  Description: This test verifies that the getQueries method returns a map containing exactly one query parameter that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the getQueries method and add a single query parameter to the queries map.
  Act: Call the getQueries method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned map contains one entry and that the entry matches the one that was added.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a map with the correct entries when a single query parameter is set. It is important to ensure that the method accurately reflects the current state of the queries map.

Scenario 3: Verify that getQueries returns the correct map with multiple query parameters set

Details:  
  TestName: getQueriesShouldReturnMapWithMultipleQueries
  Description: This test ensures that the getQueries method returns a map with all the query parameters that were added to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the getQueries method and add multiple query parameters to the queries map.
  Act: Call the getQueries method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned map contains all the entries added and that they match the expected values.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the method accurately returns a map with multiple entries. This test is crucial for verifying the method's ability to handle multiple queries, which is a common use case.

Scenario 4: Verify that getQueries is immutable

Details:  
  TestName: getQueriesShouldBeImmutable
  Description: This test checks if the map returned by the getQueries method is immutable, to prevent external modifications to the internal state of the queries map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the getQueries method and add at least one query parameter to the queries map.
  Act: Call the getQueries method and attempt to modify the returned map.
  Assert: Catch any UnsupportedOperationException thrown when trying to modify the map and assert that the exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the map returned by the getQueries method cannot be modified, thus verifying its immutability. This is significant because it protects the integrity of the internal state of the object and prevents potential side effects.

Scenario 5: Verify that getQueries returns a deep copy of the map

Details:  
  TestName: getQueriesShouldReturnDeepCopyOfMap
  Description: This test ensures that the getQueries method returns a deep copy of the queries map, preventing changes to the returned map from affecting the original map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class containing the getQueries method and add at least one query parameter to the queries map.
  Act: Call the getQueries method, modify the returned map, and then call getQueries again.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the original queries map remains unchanged after the returned map is modified.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks the integrity of the original queries map after the returned map is modified, confirming that a deep copy is returned. This is important to ensure that the method does not expose internal references, which could lead to unintended side effects.
