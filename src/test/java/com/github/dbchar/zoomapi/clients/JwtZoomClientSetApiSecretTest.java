Scenario 1: Valid Api Secret Provided

Details:  
  TestName: setValidApiSecretShouldRefreshToken
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid API secret is provided, the JWT token is refreshed accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the refreshJwtToken method to track its invocation.
  Act: Call setApiSecret with a valid API secret string.
  Assert: Verify that refreshJwtToken is called once.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the refreshJwtToken method is invoked when setApiSecret is called with a valid string, which is expected as per the method's design to refresh tokens when the API secret changes. The significance of this test is to confirm that token refresh logic is correctly tied to the API secret being set.

Scenario 2: Null Api Secret Provided

Details:  
  TestName: setNullApiSecretShouldHandleGracefully
  Description: This test checks that the method handles a null input without throwing an exception and does not attempt to refresh the JWT token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the refreshJwtToken method to track its invocation.
  Act: Call setApiSecret with a null value.
  Assert: Verify that refreshJwtToken is not called.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that refreshJwtToken is not called when a null API secret is provided, ensuring that the method handles null inputs gracefully. This test is significant because it checks the resilience of the method against null inputs, which could be a common edge case.

Scenario 3: Empty String Api Secret Provided

Details:  
  TestName: setEmptyApiSecretShouldNotRefreshToken
  Description: This test ensures that when an empty string is provided as the API secret, the JWT token is not refreshed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the refreshJwtToken method to track its invocation.
  Act: Call setApiSecret with an empty string.
  Assert: Verify that refreshJwtToken is not called.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that refreshJwtToken is not invoked with an empty string API secret, confirming that the method does not proceed with token refresh for empty values. This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior when it receives an input that is technically valid but functionally meaningless.

Scenario 4: Api Secret Provided With Whitespace

Details:  
  TestName: setApiSecretWithWhitespaceShouldRefreshToken
  Description: This test checks that the method trims the API secret and refreshes the JWT token even if the provided string contains leading or trailing whitespace.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the refreshJwtToken method to track its invocation.
  Act: Call setApiSecret with a string containing leading or trailing whitespace.
  Assert: Verify that refreshJwtToken is called once.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that refreshJwtToken is called when an API secret with whitespace is provided, assuming the method is designed to trim the input. This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to handle and normalize user input before processing.

Scenario 5: Api Secret Changed

Details:  
  TestName: setApiSecretWhenChangedShouldRefreshToken
  Description: This test confirms that the JWT token is refreshed only when the new API secret is different from the current one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an initial API secret and mock the refreshJwtToken method. Track the number of invocations.
  Act: Call setApiSecret with a different API secret.
  Assert: Verify that refreshJwtToken is called once more.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that a token refresh occurs only when the API secret actually changes. This test is significant because it ensures that unnecessary token refreshes do not occur when the same API secret is set repeatedly.

Scenario 6: Api Secret Unchanged

Details:  
  TestName: setApiSecretWhenUnchangedShouldNotRefreshToken
  Description: This test checks that the JWT token is not refreshed when the new API secret is the same as the current one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an initial API secret and mock the refreshJwtToken method to track its invocation.
  Act: Call setApiSecret with the same API secret.
  Assert: Verify that refreshJwtToken is not called again.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that refreshJwtToken is not called redundantly when the API secret remains unchanged. This test is significant to avoid unnecessary processing and ensure that the method behaves optimally.
